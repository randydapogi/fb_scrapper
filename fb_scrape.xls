0	Julie San Jose Mathews	Yes now na! Travel ban should be implemented already! Lives of every Filipino is more impt. than tourism at the moment. LORD GOD BLESS US ALL!
1	Jeanessa Matildo Ata Tumampos	I definitely agree with this! I am a fan of Duterte but heck his nonchalant reaction with regards to the issue is so disappointing üòî Kung di niya gusto nga malaen ang Chinese awe! adtos ilang balay sa Davao papuy a
2	Bhong Abastillas	yes we need it for now! prevention not relation! 
3	Emz Villamor	Too late... Hinintay p talaga mg positive... Bago mghigpit s pagpasok ng mga passenger galing China... Kakabwesit I love #du30 but this time.., talaga nagpabaya yon gobyerno! Jan 21 p CIA dumating ang dami n nakasamuha nyan... Un mga nakasabay nia s airplane at mga kapamilya kaibgan at mga nakasalamuha nia dapat check nila.... Dapat kc s airport p lng nahhigpit n cla, d handa un pinas s ganyan mga cases... God bless Philippines #DU30:-(
4	Andie Yey	YES to temporary ban!  Ban until we are ready to handle cases because the biggest challenge is handling mob mentality of people na takot and in panic mode. TIME FREEZE muna or since Pinoy tayo, taymspers!
5	Leandro Goboy	Share ko Lang saloobin ko .üòÇ  President to America : I will ban immediately  the VFA ( Visiting Force Agreement ) because of the cancellation of visa of Bato Dela Rosa. Also, cancel the invitation of US for the leaders summit.   President to Ncov that comes from China:  ü§ê (no action all)  he should order total ban of flights from the affected Area of China or not just the affected Area but all Chinese should be banned for coming here in the Philippines, but what he just  did is spoke to the public about his issues to America. And now Philippines has confirmed case of NCOV, ngayon Lang siya gagawa ng action.( kung meron man) Tangna talaga.. üò†üò†üò† Sana yakapin ka ng Chinese na may ncov Mr President.
6	Janice Stephanie	Thank you Senator but Sec Duque and Duterte are prioritizing China‚Äôs feelings.
7	Diandra Muassab	Thank you for stepping up and demanding urgent and immediate course of action from our leaders who are now disappointingly silent.
8	Sylver Sy	We need this ASAP! Let's protect our people first bago ang relationship with China I'm sure they will understand why we issued a travel ban prevention is always better than any cure!
9	Elaine Bartolome	This must be in effect immediately. Mr. President, please be reminded that you were elected by the Filipino people and not by China. Sure they cannot declare war if we ban them temporarily for a problem that they started.
10	Kristoffer Domingo	It's too late. We will be the next wuhan this coming weeks or rather worst than wuhan. I hope I'm wrong
11	Gracey Garret	What the reason bakit pinatagal pa pagbaBan. Now, we have confirmed first case infected with corona virus . . .
12	Roland Napiza	As soon as possible it needs to be implemented. We don't have enough capacity to handle this disease.
13	Ervina Samilin	Can you join forces with Kiko Pangilinan and VP Lenny to have a unified, logical and intelligent opposition against this current government? The Philippines needs crucial leadership at this point. I really hope you three can form a coalition
14	Marc Edward Dela Cruz	President Duturte what the hell are you thinking?? ban the Chinese now temporarily until this virus is neutralized! Our Public Health is at stake!
15	Judy Ann Ragos Talan	Yes. We need it right now.  I know na if sa Pilipinas galing yang Virus na yan, China won't allow any of us to enter their country.
16	Kira Yamato Merlin	Tama yan travel ban for chinese, we need to protect our fellow Filipinos. It is the most important thing we should do. Stop being hospitable and Stand for the safety of our Filipino Community.
17	Yhels Beautik	Sana as soon as the gov't knew that there is the Novel Corona Virus in China they immediately did it, Now hope it's not too late üò•
18	Yoying Pimentel	I heard in the recent press conference announcing the first confirmed case that they will now find out what airline she travelled on, seatmates, etc this patient had. Why only now?  Shouldn't those info be gathered as soon as she became a patient under investigation?
19	Victor Emmanuel F. Ogena	For this to happen the president must cooperate. But let‚Äôs be honest here, we all know that ain‚Äôt happening anytime soon. So yeah, we‚Äôre pretty much screwed. Time to turn to religion I guess?
20	Josh Tirona	Haven't always agreed to your policies But I'm with you on this one Madam senator. I'm very thankful on PRD's contributions to the country but with the stance of his cabinet that risks the lives and health of the people, you just can't support him anymore.
21	Sofia Genato	We should also ban Hong Kong and Taiwan.  
22	Ross Marc	Too late. She's been travelling for almost 4 days before having her first consultation. Imagine how many people she infected. Virus can be spread even she's asymptomatic
23	Nits Stin	Its already late, kung nagpatravel ban na before, hnd sana nkapasok ung chinese...hays...
24	Junard Bertulfo	DoH and Du30 you failed the people of the Philippines!!!!!
25	Ramon Siccion	Ban China for everything forever üôÇ
26	Jhu Ben	If that's the case then we should also ban all the other countries with confirmed cases of corona virus right? What do you think Senator? ü§îü§îü§î Just my opinion. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
27	Ezekiel Isidro	For argument's sake.   Let say nag whole ban tayo ng china from the start of 2020.   Makakapasok pa din satin ung 1st case natin ng Ncov.   Why?  Kasi from wuhan nagtravel sya pa hongkong saka napunta sa pinas. Edi pasok pa din.   No hate please. Opinion lang naman. It will be useless to ban china if other countries won't ban it as well.
28	„Çª„Ç∞„É≥„Éâ „É¨„É≥„Çπ	Best way senator to make  corona virus free here in philippines.
29	Jem Medina	This is fault of our President. He prioritize his relationship  to China than the safety & security of Filipino people!!!!!
30	Michelle Nas-Noveno	Bakit limited to China lang ang ban? How about the other countries with confirmed cases of nCoV?
31	Melody Bautista Teves	They should've put travel restrictions from The very beginning.
32	Mikky Lorence Quiring	Please include the other affected country not only china.
33	Riya LinMia Ahorro	i agree with you senator, but pls don't politicize the issue.. you and your team only comes up whenever the issue that is being tackeld is against the president. please be fair and not use the issue to attack the administration. for once let's work as a "team"!!!Riya Lin sis this kinda looks like you're the only one trying to politicize this statement? Nothing about her statement was "against the president" or is attacking anyone at all. Okay ka lang ghorl???????
34	Mia Ahorro	Riya Lin sis this kinda looks like you're the only one trying to politicize this statement? Nothing about her statement was "against the president" or is attacking anyone at all. Okay ka lang ghorl???????
35	Ivan Hulk	this is by far the biggest load of crap i ever heard... what u need is the capability to evaluate who can or cannot enter the country...the people coming from china are generating a 40 billion dollar business for the Philippines...u think the govt is going to stop that?
36	Rose Ann Cunanan	Kahit naman di from china. For sure may mga natitirang chekwa from wuhan na galing ibang bansa papunta dito. Pero mas okay yan i-ban all flights from china. Ginawa nila tayong evacuation center. üò†
37	Ner Gumafelix	Diplomatic relations with China may sour if the Philippines decides to bar mainland Chinese from entering the country - sec duque DOH
38	Ryan Ray Acierto	Ban all countries with confirmed NCOV not just china!
39	Ruby Lyn Decen	Kung kailan meron ng case ng ncov doon lang ipapaban ang travel ng china. Pinoy nga naman. Tsk tsk. Hinihintay munang magka-virus bago umaksyon. üíî Sana noon pa inaksyonan. Hindi po kasi tayo pusa na may siyam na buhay o mga immortal.
40	Myrv Tindoc	ASAP! Pag ayaw padin nilang makinig, sila dapat ang unang magwelcome sa mga parating galing china. Thanks!
41	Eritz Lee	Sa mga nagsasabi n bakit ibaBan eh sa ibang bansa like UAE/USA eh tuloy padin ang flights from china, ganito po kasi yan, 3rd world country tayo. Do you have any idea ng health/medical status ng pinas? Sa tingin nyo ba kaya ng pinas ihandle ang possibility pag dumami ang kaso ng ncov dto. Di n nga makabili ng maayos n gamot ng kababayan natin idadagdag pa ito.
42	Renz Leo Cabral Morta	Ganyan naman kayong mga lechugas kayo, tsaka aaksyon kung kelang huli na. Kung nung umpisa palang ginawa nyo na yan di na tayo maaapektuhan. Gaano kayo nakakasigurado na yung nag iisang confirmed infected ng NCov ay nag iisa lang talaga? Dito sa bansang mayaman lang ang priority ,paano naman kaming mga dukha lamang? Iintayin munang may masamang mangyare bago kumilos. Mga bobo kayong lahat.
43	Jhun Liwanag	Too late malacanan inuna nio pa atupagin ang vfa cancellation at visa ni bato kesa kapakanan ng mga mamamayang Pilipino
44	Adora Santos	It‚Äôs too late! Nakapasok na ang virus at marami na siyang nakasalamuha na nahawaan. Hintayin lang ang incubation sa Mga nahawaan. Hinintay muna makapasok bago ipa ban ang mga Chinese tourists sa pagpasok sa ating bansa.
45	Alex Derecho	Right and wise move mam. This virus is no ordinary virus, deadly and instant. We should not take it for granted thinking the less effect of other viruses. This is different as no drug and vaccine can kill this novel corona virus. Thank you po.
46	Torque Alcorcon	This is the only statement where I agree with u mam
47	Hope Pintor	Kakahiya nman kay Pres Xi Jingpin,  baka magalit kay Digong. Pinas bahala kayo mamatay, wag lng magalit China.
48	Ade Lamela	Paano ayaw nga ng leader ng bansa. Sana nga matauhan sya at ipaglaban nman nya ang ka pakanan ng mga filipino
49	Li Lii	Yes please.. and sanitize the aircrafts just like they do in Australia... and please find a place to quarantine the affected persons or better yet send it to an island or something far from populous areas in our country. Our country doesn‚Äôt have advanced medical facilities and is not as rich as the other countries thats why we have to strengthen the gates of our immigration office! Please do not just let anyone in specially those in china we are even slow in preventive measures.. I don‚Äôt know what will happen to us! Other countries that are much advanced than us have a very strict preventive measures but why cant we even do that? Please ban china from entering our country until the virus is extinguished and a cure is discovered. 
50	Mary Sara Ramirez	Oo nga buti ka pa wise takbo ka uli boto kita
51	Geoffrey Uy	Why is the health department not doin there jobs??
52	Robelene Rayala-Icalina	Senator, please enlighten me po anong country na ang nag China wide tavel ban aside from North Korea and Papua New Guinea na still epidemic ang polio? If ever we will be the first country po.
53	Jalal Oday Subair	I will go to the statement of Sen. Bong Go, we can't do a travel ban to the China because, the virus already spread to the neighboring country like HK and Singapore, so are we gonna all ban those country?  We can but we should not, the government has two option, Ban those country or strengthen the Health security of our country.
54	Jojo Bastillada	"Finally, I am asking our government to extend full assistance to our Overseas Filipino Workers, in China or in any country with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, who seek repatriation in relation to possible exposure".   How? Eh may travel ban.
55	Mary Gem Choresca	Instead free country ta di na pud ka travel outside country kag quarantine ka exile muna sa atong lugar
56	Josch Franco Miguel Roa	Hard to do this since we‚Äôre currently run by lapdogs who don‚Äôt really care. 
57	Jetz Pancho Fernandez	I think, what we need is education, awareness, right information, not paranoia. Proper hygiene as well. Just be informed.
58	Keanne Matthew Peralta	Deadly weapon  corona virus made by China.
59	Karl Payumo Caerlang	Don't just ban those Chinese. Ban also the people who resides or has a history of travel in China or strictly in Wubei.
60	Angel Rose Acuman	Also let those voyagers whose life are at risk, traveling inter-asia come home for a while, while the virus is still spreading worldwide.
61	Shiela Mae B Boston	There! Atleast someone from the Senate actually stand for what is the right thing to do. Ang problema nga lang, may positive case na tayo. The question now is, are we ready? Is our health system equipt? Kakayanin kaya natin?
62	PiVoutz JapPeqz	The president have a deep compassion to the Chinese people than the Filipino people. That's the reality....
63	Ritche Pamintuan Mama√±gun	The problem is. Would the government listen to you? When?
64	Ar Magguzman	Do you think you're talking to an able minded president? When will you realize that this is not normal anymore?ü§î
65	Leonah Irish Florencio Bayang	We demand TRAVEL BAN to all Chinese Nationals arriving to PH!
66	Jimmy Velchez	No need to worry, a vaccine has been discovered by a bunch of australian scientist that can now cure the ncov.
67	Tong Ang Merano	I agree with you Senator...its about time....
68	Ojena Monedero Danie	Dpt for safety ng laht pti n dn ng chinese n gaya nila n nkatira dto..  Quarantine and temporary lngvnmn
69	Rose Manuel	Do it now! Before it's too late!
70	Michael Bandada	For once, I agree with Sen. Hontiveros...don‚Äôt let them spread the plague! Protect the land!
71	Kriza Jane Aclan	Jason Lachica see? Mayo paja si senator .my utok musta Naman Iban ya?. Mga feeling hero . Yes to banning !
72	Royce Tan Cruz	Culpable violation of the constitution specifically Art.3 Sec.6 is an impeachable offense #PublicHealth
73	Marc Tan	This time i would say yes to you senator. PH first before anything else. DOH must have pushed this decision before hand. And may i suggest complete scanners on all airports and piers for fever before enterring PH land. Corona may come from other parts of the world not only china. We have to be vigilant.
74	Rameses De Leon	As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure
75	Arah Jane O. Martin	Temporary ban for atleast 6 months to 1 yeat
76	Genille Ejoc	Just for now. Set aside your political interest. There's no need to take side..Utang na loob!! it's either we/us die because of the virus or due to anxiety and panic attacks.
77	Mark Cabelinga	Chester Rosales this is a better and considerate wording, neutral and no hint of racism.. :)   replace "individuals travelling from China" with "people from China" and it wouldn't sound the same... :)
78	Nhoj Peter Ontiveros Dotimas	Impose now this travel ban .... Or be sorry later
79	Pablo Binas	Don't say 'BAN' senator... Murahin ka ni Digong and his DDS.
80	Peter Aucena	If 16 million voters will demand Pres. Duterte to take immediate action probably he will listen.. otherwise no!
81	Roel Cosrojas	travel ban lage but y mn nkbalik ang mga chiness somewhere in talakag.niuli cla kau chiness newyer befor  pa lumala ang NCOV,,declared n travel ban pano cla nklusot,,?
82	Tess Garvez	Why everybody is worried? If it's your time it's your time. Thousands of people died every year of flu.
83	Rhedin Guimbal Braga	why you all afraid of this virus?
84	Brian Martos Borje	You are part of the government....do something not yap at social media.
85	Glicerio Beluso Jr	Too late, they're already here. What we need to do now is to prevent the spread of the virus, everyone going out to congested places/ enclosed spaces (vans, buses, airplanes etc.) Should be wearing masks. Anyone who has a flu must isolate himself.
86	Nez Nez	dpt mtgl nyo n gnwa..bat ngyn p kng kelan meron n infected
87	Rolan Bendecio	It's not that easy. Humanity above all. Imagine if it will happen to your family.
88	Ferdinand Marasigan	May I know how many countries declared ban on chinese visitors because of corona virus? What about other countries affected, should we ban their citizens too. And since there's already a case here. Should we likewise be banned from entering other countries as well?
89	Jo-e√πn Tamesis	Definitely , we totally need  this temporary ban. Neighboring countries of china including taiwan, laos etc have done this. Why cant we??? We are not ready for an epidemic. We lack supplies, personnel, equipments, funds. The people of the nation are of at utmost priority more than anything else.
90	Mayju Dolor Aguila	Lord Jesus begging you  for help to heal all the people who are infected  of corona virus  and stop spreading  of this virus in the world Amen.
91	JB Oiga Soria	Dapat lang po Senator, sana its not yet too late
92	Genes Jr Cabale	Please... before it gets worst..  because DOH can only confirmed if the patient is being tested in the hospital.. it means it can spread the virus before they can truly detect if he/she is positive, i think the Administration is risking the lives of the filipino people they care more about the chinese rather than us filipino...
93	Fritz Liu	Travel restrictions are political theater. Not only does the evidence suggest that quarantines and travel restrictions don‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt account for the devastating economic impact and potential harm to the outbreak response that such restrictions can bring about. Instead of using airport screening and entertaining plans to seal borders, the governments of the world should focus their attention and resources on educating travelers about this new disease, and on helping China respond to the outbreak.  https://www.vox.com/2020/1/23/21078325/wuhan-china-coronavirus-travel-ban
94	Angelica Lachica Pioquid	I support you here Senator. Please save our families. We don't want to die. Not yet.
95	Kris Austria	Ban for now or die after! I support the President but tao lang tayo and we are not perfect. So the health officials should inform the President about the issue and it's urgency.
96	Lan Ca	Don't be selfish .  There's a way to be free ,if we just believe.  Banning any flight from China ,is not the solution .   Remember ,too many lives also in China. They need help not hate .  Try to put your selves in there situation. Plssss
97	Fatee Lihijah	I actually hate you. But I agree on this. üôèüëç
98	Pau Diaz	The virus is not the main problem , the main problem is china's puppet from davao ü§ôüòÅ
99	EJ Amoncio	thank you senator risa!
100	Zaldy de Villa	TOTAL LOCK DOWN OUR AIRPORT AND SEAPORT FOR CHINESE NATIONALS COMING IN
101	Lanz V. Poblete	In the first place there shouldn't be a need for the public to demand a travel ban. The government should've imposed the travel ban once the outbreak at Wuhan got out of control.
102	Allie Son	As soon as possible madam!
103	Gina P. Raviz	Too much agree Senator Risa!
104	Francis Descallar Dico	Sorry Madam Our president is Duterte. Takot s China üá®üá≥

112	Joey Mariano	Pwede naman s davao city n muna quarantine area so that our relations to china will be saved...
113	Agie-Jun Llamas	Other countries are doing so
114	Marvin Paulo Osea	Please ban all Chinese nationals from entering the Philippines. 
115	Lyn Facturanan	Department of Health (Philippines)  please read
116	Ely Chua	Very good Senator Hontiveros ! Let us Stay  Away from China...Ban china Right Now & Forever plsssss !
117	Edrian Jorvina Ador	Filipinos are asking why the government hasn't banned the Chinese from entering our country. I'll tell you why. It's not about misplaced diplomacy or tourism. It's about humanity (and a little bit of geopolitics of course)!  The most humanitarian thing the Philippines and other countries should do is HELP, lend a hand. Find a cure and heal the sick. If you find it hard to grasp, think of it this way. What if a fatal, incurable plague originates in the Philippines but the other nations close their borders and won't help us, what will you do? Remember, they are scared as much as we are.  And before you say you hate the Chinese, may I remind you that you're reading this thru a smartphone made and assembled by a Chinese company, while you're wearing clothing made in China. Last week you celebrated Chinese New Year and indulged in Chinese-inspired cuisine. You believe in Chinese zodiac and feng shui. You can't even stay up late coz you have to be early for work tomorrow otherwise, your Chinese-Filipino boss will fire you and now you can't make gala to Chinese-owned malls and restos. Pro-humanity. Don't buy the media hype. Believe that we, IGOROTS, can and will survive this pandemic.  Today, any animosity we hold, whether you're a Chinese or not, may we realize that we're in this battle as one humanity. Pray to the highest power you believe in, may we survive this novel corona together..   Repost  Copy and pasted 'coz Im in agreement with this one!üëåüëåüëå
118	Fed OU	Overdue as it may seem, the Gov't. needs to do this ...  PLEASE !!! Please help protect the people of the Phils !!!

120	Kin Enriquez	Yes, supporting this as precaution
121	Jolly Almoguerra	Temporary van China to the Philippines
122	Ja'mes Geriane Erazo	Yes we need it. Pero we don't need you.
123	Donz Kroko	I wonder how many DDS are now in panic mode.
124	JC Ranque	I think to do that we need to implement a nationwide Martial Law!! Preventing any Chinese to enter any of 7,107 islands of the Philippines seaports and airports. Kakasa ba kayo mga martial law cry babies?
125	Rick Llanes	Yes! Agree100%. Good job this time Hontiveros.
126	Trudy Renion	Malaysia is already doing it

132	Antonio Tiongson	Its a good move..but this government welcomes all people and the like coming from China..total stop...but how can you contain..if the President himself authorizes their presence..ALL CHINESE FROM WUHAN ARE WELCOME..WITH RED CARPET UPON ARRIVAL..GOING TO THE PALACE AND CONGRESS...plus prostitution...gambling...drugs..you can't ask for anything more...they are all here..but wait there is still more..our islands are taken away from us..OMG

199	Mark Peckson	It's so ironic how the DOH's indecision will lead to deaths.
200	Raymark Salonga	DOH only follows the guidelines from WHO and CDC the lead authorities in control of these infections. They do not recommend travel bans because these are not only effective but also have negative social and economic costs.. the virus coming to philippines and any other asian country is inevitable and doing a travel ban will only delay the transmission and prolong the cycle of infection when it hits the country..  The only effective meausures recommended are 1. Screening by temp and history 2. Quarantine of suspected and proven cases 3. Restricted travel TO already endemic areas, 4. Hygiene and personal protective equipment.  I hope fellow epidemiologists and infectious disease experts can do research as well and make this clear for the public! If you have other views or information regarding this feel free to comments here in my post. THANK YOU!
201	Christian Jay Nisperos	Question. should it include Filipino tourists out of the country and in these areas? How about Filipinos that want to come home to avoid the virus?  If not, and if they agree to be tested/quarantined after arrival, should we include other nationalities and not only target a specific one?  If all can be given logical answers, I am inclined to support this measure.
202	Morgenstern Der Heiligen	TBH: Since the government aint banning Chinese from goin in, which other countries have done already. I think we should take the initiative and sorta quarantine ourselves, only go to hospital if symptoms occur. That way, we burn out the virus, lack of targets.  Work from home kung pwde.
203	Kenneth Sieghart Antonio	Then implement it!
204	Melvin Gregorio	DOH sec. Is a traitor alam na natin na mas importante sa kanya ang china kesa sa kawpa pilipino. He had the power to convince our oblivious president to ban but he didnt.

457	Jm Marasigan	At his point, the UN should just quarantine China
458	George Alvin	Filipinos are asking why the government hasn't banned the Chinese from entering our country. I'll tell you why.  It's not about misplaced diplomacy or tourism. It's about humanity (and a little bit of geopolitics of course)!  More than half of the population in Europe died during the Black Death. Others fled to neighboring countries and survived thanks to strangers who welcomed them despite the peril of getting infected as well. The most humanitarian thing the Philippines and other countries should do is don't ban the flights but when they arrive, quarantine them as long as it takes. Find a cure and heal the sick. If you find it hard to grasp, think of it this way. What if a fatal, uncurable plague originates in the Philippines but the other nations close their borders and won't help us, what will you do? Remember, they are scared as much as we are.  Pro-humanity. Don't buy the media hype. Believe that we, Terrans, can and will survive this pandemic.
459	Guinevere Lim	Please open their eyes and ears that we need to have the travels from China banned. :(
460	Lene Edlos	Tamang impormasyon lang! Galing mismo kay Atty. Bruce Rivera   TO BAN OR NOT TO BAN  Ito na ang battlecry. Si PRD daw sobrang tuta ng China at hindi kayang i-ban ang mga Chinese tourists sa bansa. At may mga DDS na mukhang nagiging convinced. May dahilan bakit hindi natin pwede isarado ang airport natin from flight galing China at Hong Kong. Let me count the ways.  1. Wuhan and Hubei has already imposed a lock down so hindi na tayo matatakot na magdecide ang mga taga Wuhan na pumunta sa Pilipinas kasi di sila makakasakay ng eroplano from the city.  2. China has already instituted measures to lessen the spread of the virus like suspending air and rail travel within China. They also stopped group tours outside China. At kung may nakakalanding man, hindi din ito makakapasok sa bansa.  3. Kahit isara pa natin ang bansa natin, may confirmed case na tayo dito. Pero, here is the deal.. wala pang recorded human to human transmission unlike Germany. Reason: Hindi malamig ang Pinas kaya hirap lumipat sa iba ang NCOV. So kahit may positive na, galing sa Wuhan yan at baon nung babae.   4. If we close our borders or ban planes from China, hindi naman ang mga Chinese ang apektado dito. Kasi aside from restrictions by the government, sino ba ang gusto magbakasyon ngayon na Chinese. Moreover, we can always prevent a Chinese from entering the Philippines. Wala na ngang visa on arrival di ba?  5. Closing plane routes from China and HK will not stop transmission kasi nakakahawa kahit walang symptoms. So, its not sure kung ilan talaga ang may sakit. Ang problema kasi, we have 250k OFWs who may want to return to the Philippines na mahihirapan makauwi because we decided to ban flights. Are we ready to sacrifice our heroes because of our paranoia?  6  Dahil wala na visa on arrival, all visas given to Chinese are properly monitored where we will have enough time to prepare and we already have test kits to make sure they are not infected.   7. Hong Kong Airport is a major hub. If we ban all flights from China, it will include HK and all the other international flights that use the airport as hub. Again, are we willing to make these drastic action and the equivalent economic implications when we already know that the virus has already crossed the border.  8. Lastly, prevention is better than cure. And banning flights is not the prevention to consider at this point because it makes too many sacrifices for something that has already been a done deal. The prevention done tackles more on the personal effort of the person to not allow any avenues for infection. The reality is: banning Chinese influx will only place us in a false state of complacency, more dangerous because it gives us a sense of misplaced confidence that we have removed the fear when it may still be there.  So before we decide to insist that PRD lock us out from the Chinese, think and think so more if in the process, we managed to lock us in and become the victim of our own fears.

461	Chris Angelo Tuason	It's about time, Travel Ban from China is a must!
462	Grace Robledo-Farrell	China can build a hospital for in days they have the means Philippines has not so let them stay at their own country they created this mess and now the whole world is going to suffer. Ban NOW
463	Daniel Espejo Ruiz	Why don't we confine all the Chinese tourist who are infected with corona virus inside the Malaca√±ang Palace? And let them stay there along with Duterte and his cabinet secretaries.
464	Kirill Korotaev	2 ill Chinese already in Russia
465	Grace Nablo Arizala	Yes please do it and fight for its implementation... lets not compromise the health and welfare of Filipinos
466	Gianne Louise Arciaga Tolentino	pwede bang may magpetition nito?  we don't have enough capacity to handle situations like this. I am not being rude to the chinese people but I am saying that Filipinos don't have enough equipments, funds and etc.  and the only thing that we can do right now is to prevent this by banning you from our country.
467	Eusebio Mendiola	Mr President lets implement now the ban of Chinese citizens your responsibility and priority is your country men not Chinese  please hear the cry of your country men and provide them safetinessin their lves.
468	Bryan Pablo	(Inb4 more non sequitur tirades from DDS in regards to the issue.)  Prevention is arseloads better to begin with, but since bollocks hit the fan, THAT should be considered.
469	Sonny Enrico Urbano	Ban all Chinese especially all working in Pogo.
470	Cyril De Riviere	Yes let's save a few by banning trqvel and cause global economic chaos that will kill way more
471	Raymark Salonga	If you will close travels from china you might as well ban all travels coming from any countries.. why? Because no other countries have tavel ban FROM china going TO their country. So a person from china can go to usa then travel to philippines. Etc.. travel bans are not proven effective and have negative social and economic impact to countries. The virus coming to the pihilippines and in any asian country is inevitable but can be controlled through detection and quarantine. DOH is already doing that now. Also epidemics like this have a cycle and will eventually die down. Doing a travel ban will only delay the epidemic and prolong the cycle of infection in the country.

480	Mike Gayatano	Don't worry love ni duterte Ang communist China pati corona virus no ban to China
481	Ronnie Acha	Doctor's advice about coronavirus:  1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.  2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly.  3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus.  About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus:  1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days  2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days.  3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this.  About prevention:  1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly).  2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with strong mouthwash to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs).  Folks, take extra care and drink plenty of water.  copy, paste and repost.

523	Raymark Salonga	https://www.who.int/ith/2020-27-01-outbreak-of-Pneumonia-caused-by-new-coronavirus/en/  WHO advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event.
524	Lady Lin	The EVIDENCE on TRAVEL BANS for diseases like CORONAVIRUSES is clear:   THEY DONT WORK...  They‚Äôre political theater, not good public health policy.  It would be one thing if there were strong evidence that travel bans work. But the trouble is, they don‚Äôt appear to be helpful. At best, travel restrictions, and even airport screenings, delay the spread of disease but don‚Äôt impact the number of people who eventually get sick. Instead, they make it harder for international aid and experts to reach communities affected by disease. They are also expensive, resource-intensive, and potentially harmful to the economies of cities and countries involved.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2020/1/23/21078325/wuhan-china-coronavirus-travel-ban  #nopanic #stop_misinformation

600	Edrian Jorvina Ador	Filipinos are asking why the government hasn't banned the Chinese from entering our country. I'll tell you why. It's not about misplaced diplomacy or tourism. It's about humanity (and a little bit of geopolitics of course)!  The most humanitarian thing the Philippines and other countries should do is HELP, lend a hand. Find a cure and heal the sick. If you find it hard to grasp, think of it this way. What if a fatal, incurable plague originates in the Philippines but the other nations close their borders and won't help us, what will you do? Remember, they are scared as much as we are.  And before you say you hate the Chinese, may I remind you that you're reading this thru a smartphone made and assembled by a Chinese company, while you're wearing clothing made in China. Last week you celebrated Chinese New Year and indulged in Chinese-inspired cuisine. You believe in Chinese zodiac and feng shui. You can't even stay up late coz you have to be early for work tomorrow otherwise, your Chinese-Filipino boss will fire you and now you can't make gala to Chinese-owned malls and restos. Pro-humanity. Don't buy the media hype. Believe that we, IGOROTS, can and will survive this pandemic.  Today, any animosity we hold, whether you're a Chinese or not, may we realize that we're in this battle as one humanity. Pray to the highest power you believe in, may we survive this novel corona together..   Repost  Copy and pasted 'coz Im in agreement with this one!üëåüëåüëå

610	John Candz	The level of uninformed, hate, and stupidity of pinoys.. mas viral pa kaysa corona virus..  Droplet not airbourne.. theres now a cure, with a low mortality rate..  So why propagate mass hysteria? Ay, kase gagamitin nyo for political advancement. Very low..
611	Mary Jade Garcia	This cunt of a government can send special flights to retrieve Filipino nationals who in the process gets stuck by the ban, which by the way is far from approval.
612	Richmond Jhay David Cesniros	There is way too much hype and misinformation surrounding this novel corona virus. Common cold, flus and stds that killed hundredths of thousands every year. A disease like sars with a death rate of 10% and ebola with 50% death rate compared to ncov virus is too less to be anxious about. Most of the deaths in china are those with compromised immune system that includes old people, very young people and those immunosuppresed. All this is that we should not allow ourselves to make news cause us panic. We must be alert not anxious!
613	Shahani Gania	Ban them and close all these Chinese prostitution dens please!
614	Lady Lin	KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 ‚Äï There is NOT ENOUGH DATA to suggest that BLANKET TRAVEL BANS against Chinese nationals will be EFFECTIVE in containing the spread of the Wuhan virus, medical practitioners and health advocates have explained amid an uproar among some Malaysians.  https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/01/29/ban-all-chinese-from-entering-no-evidence-plan-will-contain-coronavirus-hea/1832324  #nopanic #stop_misinformation
